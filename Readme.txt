For now we've built two main front end pages. One(index.html) for our home page and the other(movies.html) for avaiable movie page.

We have Jquery and bootstrap in this part of the project.

We're currently establishing pages for possible movie forum and tickets selling system pages. The discussion for database is on going.

Timeline:
Nov 5: further front end design
Nov 12: Front end finish and review
Nov 19: database design finish
Nov 26: alpha test with everything

The goal is to wrap up everything before Dec.
