# Movie Forum Website

Project of Guojing Zhang

Designed an online system for administrators and customers to access the information of different movies according to their need. 

For customers, they can see information about the movies they like. We have about at most 10 movies in total shown in the cinema. After watching the movie, you could communicate with our other customers about it using forum function. Before leaving review or comment review, you must log in your account. Customers have the ability to publish a new review and comment another customersâ€™ review. To make our website more manageable we will create several functionalities for administrators.

For administrators, they can not only check reviews of movies and delete them which contain dirty words or unhealthy information, but also open a new topic discussion board. 

This project use CSS and html to beatify our front-end design. When it comes to connecting to other pages, JavaScript functions and jQuery are performed to ensure the functionality. We also used MONGODB to manage our users and website.
